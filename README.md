## General info

This app helped me in my work on greek island Corfu. I worked as holiday representative and every single day I collected many car rental orders from tourists. I talking on the phone and I needed to write down all informations. So I made this app and I was using it on my second phone. This app saves all data to localstorage so it is possible to check all previous orders.
